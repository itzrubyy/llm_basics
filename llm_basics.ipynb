The goal of machine learning is to enable machines to make decisions and predictions without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario.\\n\\nMachine learning is based on the idea of patterns in data. It involves analyzing large amounts of data to identify relationships between variables, and using this information to make predictions or decisions. There are three main types of machine learning'"
